                    My name is Johannes Ekengren, and I am a software engineer. I am coming up on 10 years as a software
                    engineer and 6 of those years in the video game industry. I have worked on 3 AAA video game titles,
                    Need for Speed Heat, Battlefield 2042 and Need for Speed Unbound. At my latest job I helped build a
                    game called Godbreakers, which were composed of a smaller team where I had a big impact on shaping
                    the game. It truly was a passion project which I am very proud of.

                        a 3D action roguelite game. I had sole responsible for all UI implementation,
                        including UI systems, layouting, UI shader creation. Used C++ and Unreal Engine.

                        Worked on Battlefield 2042 during development and live service. Worked with
                        UI, bootflow, and customization for weapons, characters, vehicle etc. Got
                        outsourced to Criterion during finalization of Need for Speed Unbound, helped
                        out with telemetry, polish and bug fixing due to the experience on previous
                        Need for Speed title. Used C++, C# and Frostbite.

                        Worked on Need for Speed Heat during development and live service. Did
                        various gameplay features, most notably I had main responsibility for the
                        underlying system for collectibles. This handled triggering, tracking, storage
                        and presentation of progress for all collectibles in the game. Used C++, C# and
                        Frostbite
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work at To The Sky, DICE and Ghost Games involves project with a size of
                        around 30 to 300 to 600 people. This taught me that good communication
                        between close co-workers and across departments are key to be able to deliver
                        a good product. We used project tools such as JIRA, Hansoft, Perforce, etc.

                        Worked on a VR simulation software for the mining and tunneling industry. I
                        worked in a small team where I got to choose and prioritize what work that
                        needed to be done. I had the main responsibility of the rendering pipeline and
                        implemented forward and deferred rendering with a PBR workflow, moment
                        shadow mapping and more. Used C++, OpenGL and TypeScript.
